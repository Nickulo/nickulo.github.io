            <h2> Profit Growth</h2>
            <p>Nowadays, many companies integrate digital marketing into their business plan to try to increase their profit, through advertising aimed at a specific target audience and monitoring of the latter to try to learn their interests and how they think.</p>

                <p class="text">Digital Marketing has been able to bring small and medium-sized businesses back into play by providing them with resources that were previously only accessible to larger companies. Let's take as an example a hotel called "Hotel Azzurra", accustomed to spending exorbitant amounts for advertising on printed paper and local signs, we have created a landing page capable of effectively enclosing all the hotel services, then sending traffic to this page via a 2-month Google Ads campaign (June - July).
                    Within 60 days (01/06/2020 - 31/07/2020), the Google Ads campaign generated 1329 requests for quotations for € 2506 spent, or a cost of € 1.89 for each request. These contacts turned into bookings in 5% of cases, with an average stay value of € 400. It should be noted that a local billboard (province of Rimini) in a good location can require up to € 3,000 for 15 days of presence, without the ability to monitor the return on investment. All this serves to show that you don't have to spend big bucks to get positive results in Digital Marketing.</p>

            <p class="text"> For a small or medium-sized business, sticking to a defined budget is essential. Investing in people to promote your services and products can be tremendously expensive in the long run.
                A strong online presence can help you increase your sales and reach your audience more efficiently.
                Here is a conceptual scheme that highlights the differences in investing in traditional marketing and digital marketing</p>

            <h2> Market Analysis</h2>
            <p>The development of successful business strategies is often focused only on the authenticity of a market idea: an innovative vision is not enough, however, to achieve significant business goals, infact, an accurate market analysis is essential. Market analysis is a specific analytical research that companies use to study the economic context in which they operate, the reference sector of the business and the behavior of their target audience. A market analysis carried out correctly allows commercial realities to become aware of the profit opportunities or risk factors present in a determinate market.</p>

                <h2 class="heading">Market Analysis, the mindset</h2>
                <p class="text"> Carrying out a market analysis is particularly important for a new company with the aim of positioning itself positively and the intention to minimize risk factors. This doesnâ€™t mean, however, that a company that is already solidly established should no longer carry out market analysis. In fact, it is essential to carry out market analysis periodically over time, since our reality is in constant change of people's thinking, and therefore also of the market itself. Furthermore, it is necessary to carry out regular market analyzes if you do not want to lose your position in your market. </p>
